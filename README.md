# Nginx-JMeter-performance-testing

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on testing the performance of an **Nginx server** under different conditions using **Apache JMeter**. The goal is to evaluate **response times, throughput, CPU usage**, and **the impact of different request types and payload sizes**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features Tested  
- **Request Speed (Throughput)** â€“ Measured how many requests per second the server can handle.  
- **Types of Requests** â€“ Compared performance between `GET` and `POST` requests.  
- **Payload Size** â€“ Tested how Nginx handles different sizes of data.  
- **CPU Usage Monitoring** â€“ Checked real-time CPU load using `top`, `htop`, and `pidstat`.
